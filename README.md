# AI Virtual Try-On Application

This is a web application built with Next.js that allows users to virtually try on clothing items using AI. Users upload a photo of themselves and a photo of a clothing item, and the application leverages the Google Gemini API to generate an image simulating the user wearing the clothing.

## Features

*   üëï **Clothing Image Upload:** Upload a photo of a clothing item.
*   üñºÔ∏è **Image Previews:** See previews of the uploaded images.
*   ‚ú® **AI-Powered Try-On:** Uses the Google Gemini API (specifically a flash experimental model) to generate the virtual try-on image.
*   ‚úÖ **Result Display:** Shows the generated image result.
*   ‚è≥ **Loading State:** Displays a loading indicator while the AI is processing.
*   üîÑ **Reset Functionality:** Easily clear all inputs and results.
*   üé® **Simple UI:** Clean interface built with Tailwind CSS.

*   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **AI Model:** [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api) (via `@google/genai` SDK)
*   **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
*   **Package Manager:** npm

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
*   A **Google Gemini API Key**: You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository (or Download Code):**
    ```bash
    # Replace with your actual repository URL if applicable
    git clone https://github.com/usman4222/ai-try-on.git
    cd gemini-ai-tryon
    ```
    Alternatively, if you have the code locally, navigate to the project's root directory.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project directory.
    *   Add your Google Gemini API Key to this file:
        ```plaintext
        # .env.local
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```
    *   Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` with the actual key you obtained from Google AI Studio.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Open the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1.  The application interface will load.
2.  Click the "Upload Your Photo" input section (or the button within it) and select an image file of a person. A preview will appear.
3.  Click the "Upload Clothing Item" input section and select an image file of a clothing item. A preview will appear.
4.  Click the "Try It On!" button.
5.  A loading indicator will appear while the AI generates the image. This may take several seconds.
6.  If successful, the resulting "try-on" image will be displayed below the form.
7.  If an error occurs (e.g., API issue, invalid input), an error message will be displayed. Check the browser console and backend terminal logs for more details.
8.  Click the "Reset" button at any time to clear the uploaded images, previews, results, and any error messages.
